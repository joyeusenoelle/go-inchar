[In Nomine](http://www.sjgames.com/in-nomine) and D&D character generators in [Go](https://golang.org/)

My first big project in any new language is a character generator. It involves an understanding of functions, data types, randomness, and user input and output, so it's a good proof of language acquisition.

(The D&D character generator is here because I forgot which system I was coding for and decided to do both.)

Make sure the files in `src/util` are somewhere your Go compiler can find them, either by relocating the files or by adding their directory to your `$GOPATH`.
